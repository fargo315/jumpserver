# 启动
# vault server --log-level=debug -config=vault.hcl

# Launch a new terminal session, and set VAULT_ADDR environment variable.
# export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'

# To initialize Vault use vault operator init. This is an unauthenticated request, but it only works on brand new Vaults without existing data:
# vault operator init

# Initialization outputs two incredibly important pieces of information: the unseal keys and the initial root token.
# This is the only time ever that all of this data is known by Vault, and also the only time that the unseal keys should ever be so close together.

# Begin unsealing the Vault:
# vault operator unseal
